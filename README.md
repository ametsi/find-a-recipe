## Coding Assignment : Recipe Finder
  * online 'Coursera' course : Ruby on Rails - An Introduction 
  * offered by : Johns Hopkins University 
  * course link : https://www.coursera.org/learn/ruby-on-rails-intro/

The overall goal of this assignment is to implement a Rails application using model,
view, and controller classes.

  * the model class will access information.
  * the view class will display information and accept commands from the user.
  * the controller class will implement actions through internal service logic
    and the delegation to model and view classes.

The functional goal is to provide web page access to recipe information
served by `http://food2fork.com/api` through JSON and images. Documentation for the 
API can be found at http://food2fork.com/about/api

Access the bootstrap files on Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bwvt4e6DQqn4VE5id1lJeGtLams 

### Functional Requirements

You are tasked with creating a Rails app that will display a recipe
index page based on a search keyword entered.  

  * the user will supply a keyword to search for. 
  * the Rails app will pass that query to `http://food2fork.com/api` and accept the
    results.
  * the Rails app will build a web page display of the results and accept the next keyword
    search.
  * the web page displayed will provide HTML links to more detailed recipe information
    from other web sites.

Remember, you will not need to `require` HTTParty gem in your code, since loading 
HTTParty gem should be the Bundler's job.

You are also tasked with deploying your solution to Heroku - to be accessed by 
friends, family, other students, co-workers, and prospective employers.

### Getting Started

1. Create a new Rails application using the `rails` command called `recipefinder`.

2. Download and extract the starter set of boostrap files. 

    * replace the generated Gemfile with the Gemfile from the bootstrap fileset.
    * run the `bundle` command to resolve new gems. 

    ```shell
    |-- Gemfile
    |-- README.md
    |-- .rspec (important hidden file)
    `-- spec
        |-- recipes_app_spec.rb
        `-- spec_helper.rb
    ```

3. Install the following gems used by the rspec unit tests. You may have
some of these already installed. The last gem is used for headless 
web page testing.

    ```shell
    $ gem install rspec
    $ gem install rspec-its
    $ gem install capybara
    $ gem install poltergeist
    ```

4. Make sure phantomJS is installed and in your bin PATH on your system
($ phantomjs --version). This binary is used by the `poltergeist`
gem to implement a headless unit test for the Web interface.  You can
interact with your Rails app directly using a browser without this
library. It is only needed by the rspec tests to provide you feedback
for example criteria the grader will be looking for later when submitted.
In case you need more information, the download URLs are below.  
Linux users will need to use version 1.9.8 or build from source. 
All other platforms can easily use 2.0.0.

    * phantomjs downloads: http://phantomjs.org/download.html
    * bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/ariya/phantomjs/downloads

5. Run the rspec test(s) to receive feedback. They can be run from their original location.
If you copy/move them, be sure to include the important `.rspec` hidden file. All tests
will (obviously) fail until you complete the specified solution.

    ```shell
    Finished in 1.69 seconds (files took 0.41211 seconds to load)
    8 examples, 8 failures

    Failed examples:

    rspec ./spec/recipes_app_spec.rb:6 # Recipes App displays 
        'Kahl√∫a-Spiked' when request parameter 'search' is mocha
    rspec ./spec/recipes_app_spec.rb:11 # Recipes App utilizes 
        the FOOD2FORK_SERVER_AND_PORT environment variable
    rspec ./spec/recipes_app_spec.rb:16 # Recipes App utilizes 
        the FOOD2FORK_KEY environment variable
    rspec ./spec/recipes_app_spec.rb:24 # Recipes App visit root 
        displays chocolate (default)
    rspec ./spec/recipes_app_spec.rb:28 # Recipes App visit root 
        displays 'Powered By Food2Fork.com'
    rspec ./spec/recipes_app_spec.rb:32 # Recipes App visit root 
        displays table element that has a row with 3 columns
    rspec ./spec/recipes_app_spec.rb:36 # Recipes App visit root 
        column 1 should have the thumbnail inside img tag inside a link tag
    rspec ./spec/recipes_app_spec.rb:40 # Recipes App visit root 
        title should be inside a second column inside a link tagink tag
    ```

6. Implement your Rails app solution and use the rspec tests to help 
verify your completed Rails app solution.

7. Post your Rails app solution to Heroku.

8. Submit your Rails app solution for grading.

### Technical Requirements

1. Create a new Rails app called `recipefinder`. Use the Gemfile provided
in the boostrap files. Do not change the Gemfile from what is provided
or your submitted solution may not be able to be processed by the grader
(i.e., do not add any additional gems or change gem versions).

2. Generate `RecipesController` (recipes_controller.rb) that will have an
`index` action

3. The `RecipesController` index action should

    * check if a request parameter `search` was passed in. 
    * use the `search` term as the keyword if supplied, and use a default value of `chocolate` if 
      not supplied.

4. Create a model, `Recipe` (recipe.rb) that will contain a `for` class
method.

5. The `Recipe` `for` class method should 

    * take a keyword to query.
    * query the Food2Fork API for a result. 
    * add the HTTP query parameter `key` (your developer key) to each 
      outgoing URL request to `http://food2fork.com/api` using HTTParty `default_params`.
    * obtain the key value from an environment variable `FOOD2FORK_KEY`.
    * obtain the url (and/or port) value from an environment variable `FOOD2FORK_SERVER_AND_PORT`.

    You will use the `http://food2fork.com/api` host and port# (default=:80)
    during development and Heroku deployment.  However, your assignment
    will be graded off-line and should get its host and port# from the
    `FOOD2FORK_SERVER_AND_PORT` environment variable. Your assignment must use
    the defined value if present and default to the real value otherwise.

    ```ruby
    class Recipe
        ...
        key_value = ENV['FOOD2FORK_KEY']
        hostport = ENV['FOOD2FORK_SERVER_AND_PORT'] || 'www.food2fork.com'
        base_uri "http://#{hostport}/api"
        ...
    ```

6. Foods2Fork requires attribution when using their API. Place the following somewhere 
in your application layout file (`application.html.erb`) to be displayed alongside the recipes.

    ```
    <p>Powered By Food2Fork.com</p>
    ```
7. Create your view that should 

    * list each recipe as a row in an HTML table (`<table>`).
    * Each row (`<tr>`) should have 3 columns (`<td>`) where 
        - column 1 should contain the thumbnail of the recipe, 
        - column 2 should contain the title and 
        - column 3 should contain the social rank of the recipe.

    You are not required to create an HTML form for the search term. You may 
    specify the search keyword using just the URL with the following syntax
    in the browser.

    ```url
    http://localhost:3000/recipes/index?search=swiss
    ```

8. Add `href` tags to your image and title. You should
be able to click on either the title or the thumbnail and go
straight to the actual recipe (out there on the web). Look
at `image_tag` Rails helper for help with defining an `img` tag
(http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/AssetTagHelper.html#method-i-image_tag)
and use this helper as the first argument to `link_to` helper.

9. Inside the `image_tag` specify `width` and `height` of 100 for your images.

10. Sanitize recipe titles displayed. Rails automatically
escapes HTML in your strings (to avoid XSS attacks
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting). Because
of this, some of your titles will look wrong. For example,
try searching for `mocha` and look at your titles. To
get around this issue, Rails has a `sanitize` (or `raw`) helper
(http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/SanitizeHelper.html#method-i-sanitize)
that will help you display HTML characters properly.

11. Make the `RecipesController` `index` action the default (root) page
for your application. Instead of having to go to `http://localhost:3000/recipes/index`
to get to your recipes, you want this page to be the
default (root). You should therefore be able to go to
`http://localhost:3000/?search=apple%20pie` for example and see your
results.

12. Deploy your app to Heroku at `https://<app-name>.herokuapp.com/`. The app 
developed can be found at : https://find-a-recipe.herokuapp.com/. Instructions 
for doing that can be found below as well as at the following link: 
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars#example
	
    Deploying to Heroku

    * First, you need to have a `Heroku` account. After signing up, download and install 
	  the `Heroku Toolbelt` appropriate to your Operating System. Open up the console and type 
	
    ```shell
	heroku login 
    ```
	
	It will finish installing the toolbelt and ask you for your credentials. More 
	details on `Heroku Toolbelt` page : `https://toolbelt.heroku.com/`
	
	* Set the `FOOD2FORK_KEY` environment variable by running :
	
    ```shell
	heroku config:set FOOD2FORK_KEY=<your-api-key>
    ```
	
	* Add the following to your `Gemfile` :
	
    ```shell
	group :production do
		gem 'pg'
		gem 'rails_12factor'
	end
    ```
	
	Find where gem `sqlite3` is on `Gemfile` and move it to a group, like the following : 
	
    ```shell
	group :development, :test do
		gem 'sqlite3'
	end
    ```
		
	Generally, make sure your `Gemfile` looks like this :
	
	`https://github.com/jhu-ep-coursera/fullstack-course1-module3/blob/master/Gemfile`
	
	* Run : 
	
    ```shell
	bundle --without production
    ```
	
	* Initialize and commit to `git` :
	
    ```shell
	git init
		
	git add .
		
	git commit -m "<commit description>"
    ```
	
	* Create a `Heroku` app :
	
    ```shell
	heroku create <app-name>
    ```
	
	* Push to `Heroku` : 
	
    ```shell
	git push heroku master
    ```
	
	* Migrate your database : 
		
    ```shell
	heroku run rake db:migrate
    ```
	
	* Visit you application : 
	
    ```shell
	heroku open
    ```

### Self Grading/Feedback

Some unit tests have been provided in the bootstrap files and provide 
examples of some tests the grader will be evaluating for when you submit 
your solution. They can be run from any location but be sure to copy the 
hidden `.rspec` file if you move them. 

```shell
$ rspec 
...
Recipes App
  displays 'Kahl√∫a-Spiked' when request parameter 'search' is mocha
  utilizes the FOOD2FORK_SERVER_AND_PORT environment variable
  utilizes the FOOD2FORK_KEY environment variable
  visit root
    displays chocolate (default)
    displays 'Powered By Food2Fork.com'
    displays table element that has a row with 3 columns
    column 1 should have the thumbnail inside img tag inside a link tag
    title should be inside a second column inside a link tag

Finished in 2.73 seconds (files took 0.54954 seconds to load)
8 examples, 0 failures
```

The tests assume your server is running on localhost:3000. Please adjust
the source code in `recipes_app_spec.rb` if that is not the case with 
your development environment.

  ```ruby
  Capybara.app_host = "http://localhost:3000"
  ```


### Submission

Submit an .zip archive (other archive forms not currently supported)
with your solution root directory as the top-level, e.g., your Gemfile
and sibling files must be in the root of the archive and *not* in a
sub-folder.  The grader will replace the spec files with fresh copies
and will perform a test with different query terms.
